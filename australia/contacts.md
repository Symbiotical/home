## Emergency Services \(Police, Fire, Medical\)

If in Australia call 000 or 112 \(From a mobile/cell phone\) then say if after "Police" or "Fire" or "Ambulance" clear.

You must stay on the line to tell them of your geographical location \(street address\). 

Do NOT assume the emergency services can trace you call.

Is it possible to send your GPS coordinates to 000 via SMS? I think not?
