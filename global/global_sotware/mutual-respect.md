# Mutual Respect

## Definitions.

Active and Passive:

**Active** means you are affecting others. Example: Making \(Broadcasting\) loud noise \(yelling, talking load etc\). Making no attempt to be passive.

Examples: ****The following human sensors detect "Active". Hearing \(sound via vibrations\), physical contact, smell's

**Passive:** You are not affecting others. Listen to

Example: Thinking, reading, watching, listening \(low volume\).

When in public area's, consider others, do not do what you would want other to do to you \(10 fold\). Be passive.

Public area's \(Public Transport\) is not your lounge room, bedroom, smoking room, entertainment room, dinning table, kitchen, back yard or bathroom!

Leave the place you are leaving in the same state \(or better, cleaner\) than when you arrived!

If you leave rubbish / trash in public areas thinking it's OK because your keeping cleaners employed. We'll you can pay for the cleaners, why should others also pay that make some effort in keeping neat and tidy and pay higher price for public / private resources to cover the cost of cleaning?

In your own private area's \(bed room, house, farm\) etc you can be Active \(if it does not affect others without prior consent\). Bear in mind others may be trying to study, read or listen to important \(emergency announcements\).



## Can I become who I want to be?

That's a tough question but thankfully, our team is on it. Please bear with us while we're investigating.

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
